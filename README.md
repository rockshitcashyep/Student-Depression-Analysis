## 🧠 Student Depression Analysis Dashboard (SQL + Tableau)

This project presents an interactive dashboard for analyzing patterns of **depression among students**, built using **Tableau** for visualization and **SQL** for data preprocessing and transformation. The objective is to uncover insights that can help understand mental health trends in student populations and inform preventive strategies.

---

### 🚀 Project Overview

This dashboard is designed to explore student mental health indicators, focusing on depression-related symptoms, demographic factors, academic pressure, and lifestyle habits. The dataset was cleaned and structured using SQL, and visualized through Tableau for interactive exploration.

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **SQL** – For data cleaning, filtering, and transformation  
- **Tableau** – For designing interactive visual dashboards  
- **CSV/Excel** – Raw dataset imported into SQL for preprocessing  
- **Tableau Desktop** – For report building and publishing  

---

### 🧹 Data Preparation (SQL)

The following transformations were done using SQL:

- Removed incomplete or duplicate records  
- Normalized categorical variables  
- Created age groups and academic performance bands  
- Performed aggregations for KPIs like depression prevalence by gender, stream, and academic year  
- Joined multiple tables (if applicable) to prepare an analysis-ready dataset  

---

### 📈 Dashboard Features

Key sections of the Tableau dashboard include:

- **Demographic Breakdown**: Gender, age group, and academic stream  
- **Depression Indicator Trends**: Stress levels, sleep patterns, isolation, and mood changes  
- **Comparative Views**: Depression levels across different grades or departments  
- **Heatmaps & Bar Charts**: Highlighting high-risk groups and key contributing factors  
- **Interactive Filters**: Allow users to drill down by gender, stream, or year of study  

---

### 🔍 Key Insights

- Female students reported slightly higher symptoms of depression compared to male students  
- Students with poor sleep quality and high academic pressure were more likely to report depressive symptoms  
- First-year students exhibited more signs of adjustment-related stress  
- A strong link was observed between lack of social interaction and reported mental health decline  

---

### 📎 Usage

To explore the dashboard:

1. Open the `.twb` file in **Tableau Desktop**  
2. Ensure the dataset is connected (can be local SQL DB or Excel export)  
3. Use the filters to analyze depression trends across different student segments  
4. Export visuals for reports or presentations if needed

### 📂 Dataset Source

The dataset used in this project was sourced from [insert source if known, e.g., Kaggle / self-collected survey / academic project]. It contains anonymized responses from students covering demographics, habits, and self-reported mental health symptoms.
